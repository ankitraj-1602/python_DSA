# The owner of a BakeHouse wants to keep track of the tables 
# that are occupied in his cafe. Assume that there are 10 tables in his cafe numbered from 1 to 10. As and when a table is occupied, it must be added to the occupied_table_list and when a customer leaves, the corresponding table must be removed from the list.

# BakeHouse
# - occupied_table_list
# __init__()
# + get_occupied_table_list()
# + allocate_table()
# + deallocate_table(table_number)
# Write a python program to implement BakeHouse class. 
# Represent occupied_table_list using an appropriate data 
# structure.


# Note: Table numbers should be maintained in ascending order in the occupied_table_list.


# Tables should be allocated and de-allocated as mentioned in the example below:

# Example: Suppose tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 are initially allocated. Now if a new customer arrives, he should be allocated table 5 and the table list should be accordingly updated. If now customer at table 2 leaves, table list should be accordingly updated and the next new customer should be allocated table 2 as it is the first free table.


# Implement the allocation logic in allocate_table() method and de-allocation logic in deallocate_table() method.

# 10.Write a python program to reverse a linked list containing 
# integer data.
# Use the LinkedList class and methods in it to implement the
#  above program
